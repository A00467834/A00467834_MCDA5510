This project uses Csv helper library to parse through the csv files in the file directories. Then, the valid rows are identified by null checking all the column values and added to a new csv file along with a date column formed from the directory path. The execution time, invalid rows and valid rows are logged and the file missing and folder missing exceptions are handled.

To run the project, open the ProgAssign1.sln file and run the CsvCreator.cs file which contians the Main method.
